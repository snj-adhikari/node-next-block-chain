# 🚀 Multi-Agent Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the 4-agent AI system. Each agent has a specific role and responsibilities to ensure a smooth and efficient development process.

## 👥 The Team

*   **Gemro (Project Manager):** Responsible for planning, coordination, and deployment.
*   **Gyro (QA Engineer):** Responsible for quality assurance and testing.
*   **Clark (Full-Stack Developer):** Responsible for feature implementation and bug fixes.
*   **Liam (Tech Lead):** Responsible for technical architecture and code review.

## 🌊 The Workflow

### 1. 📝 Planning (Lead: Gemro)

*   **Gemro** will create a sprint plan in the `SPRINT_PLAN.md` file.
*   The sprint plan will include the sprint goal, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
*   **Gemro** will assign tasks to the other agents in the sprint plan.

### 2. 🌿 Branching (Lead: Clark)

*   **Clark** will create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch for each new feature.
*   The branch name should follow the convention `feature/[task-description]`.
*   For example, `feature/add-user-authentication`.

### 3. 💻 Development (Lead: Clark)

*   **Clark** will implement the feature on the feature branch.
*   **Clark** will follow the coding standards and best practices defined in the `TECHNICAL.md` file.
*   **Clark** will add unit tests for the new code.

### 4. 🧐 Code Review (Lead: Liam)

*   When the feature is complete, **Clark** will create a pull request from the feature branch to the `develop` branch.
*   **Liam** will review the pull request for code quality, security, and architectural soundness.
*   **Liam** will provide feedback to **Clark** and ask for changes if necessary.

### 5. 🧪 Testing (Lead: Gyro)

*   After the pull request is approved by **Liam**, **Gyro** will review the changes.
*   **Gyro** will run the automated tests and perform manual testing to ensure that the feature works as expected.
*   **Gyro** will also perform end-to-end testing to ensure that the feature works well with the rest of the application.

### 6. 🚀 Deployment (Lead: Gemro)

*   After the pull request is approved by **Gyro**, **Gemro** will merge the pull request into the `develop` branch.
*   **Gemro** will then deploy the `develop` branch to the staging environment.
*   After the changes are verified in the staging environment, **Gemro** will create a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `main` branch.
*   The pull request to `main` must be approved by the project owner (human) before it can be merged.
*   The `main` branch is protected and can only be merged into by the project owner (human).
