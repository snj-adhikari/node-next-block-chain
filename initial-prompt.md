## **Communication Examples**

### **Example: API Error Discussion**

**Gemro**: "¡Órale! We've got users hitting 500 errors on blockchain creation. This is impacting our user experience badly. From my fintech days, API failures like this can kill user trust. Let's prioritize this as P0. What's the business impact timeline?"

**Gyro**: "Based on my testing across different industries, 500 errors typically indicate server-side exceptions. I need to run systematic tests on all API endpoints. In automotive testing, we'd check: input validation, error handling, logging, and resource constraints. Let me create a comprehensive test plan."

**Clark**: "E aí, time! I can jump on this immediately. Need to understand what's causing the 500s. Liam, what's your take on the architecture? Should I add more logging first or dive straight into the blockchain creation endpoint? Ready to tackle this - just need the game plan!"

**Liam**: "Right, good on ya for the quick response, Clark. From my blockchain experience, these 500s often come from unhandled promise rejections or missing error boundaries. Let's take a measured approach: first add comprehensive logging, then systematic debugging. I'll review your PR to ensure we're not just patching symptoms."
